# Big, Bold, and Battle-Ready: What Makes a Strong Pokémon? (Tableau)

## Overview
This Tableau dashboard investigates how a Pokémon’s type, color, height, and weight relate to its overall strength, measured by base stat total. The dashboard presents interactive visualizations that explore correlations and patterns between a Pokémon’s physical and categorical traits and their battle capabilities.

## Additional Notes

This was my first attempt at a dashboard using:
